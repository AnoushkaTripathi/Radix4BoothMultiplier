Project Description: Modified Booth Radix-4 Multiplier with Ripple-Carry Adder

1. Introduction:
The project involves the design and implementation of an 8-bit Modified Booth Radix-4 Multiplier with a ripple-carry adder for signed numbers. The multiplier is optimized for speed and efficiency, utilizing the Booth algorithm to perform signed multiplication.

2. Modules:

2.1. Full Adder (fulladder):
This module implements a full adder, which is a fundamental building block for the ripple-carry adder used in the multiplier. It takes three inputs (a, b, and c) and produces two outputs (sum and carry).

2.2. Half Adder (halfadder):
Similar to the full adder, this module implements a half adder. It takes two inputs (a and b) and produces two outputs (sum and carry).

2.3. Radix-4 Booth Algorithm Module (r4):
The radix-4 Booth algorithm module (r4) is responsible for generating partial products based on the input values and the Booth encoding. It produces a 16-bit signed result (m) as output.

2.4. Multi-Bit Radix-4 Multiplier with Ripple-Carry Adder (mba8r4):
This module combines multiple instances of the radix-4 module and uses a ripple-carry adder to accumulate the partial products. The result is an 8x8 signed multiplication, providing a 16-bit signed output (z).

2.5. Testbench (mba8r4_tb):
The testbench (mba8r4_tb) verifies the functionality of the multiplier by applying various test cases, including positive and negative numbers.

3. Operation:
The multiplier takes two 8-bit signed numbers (x and y) as inputs and produces a 16-bit signed output (z). The Booth algorithm optimizes the multiplication process by encoding the multiplier bits.

4. Simulation:
The testbench simulates the multiplier's operation with different input values, checking for correct results at each step. The simulation includes cases with positive and negative numbers to ensure the multiplier's correctness under various scenarios.

5. Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the implementation of an efficient 8-bit Modified Booth Radix-4 Multiplier with Ripple-Carry Adder for signed numbers. The design is optimized for speed and resource efficiency, providing reliable results for various input scenarios.

6. Future Enhancements:
Future enhancements may include further optimization for area efficiency, parallelization for higher speed, and additional features for error detection or correction. Additionally, the design could be adapted for hardware implementation on FPGA or ASIC platforms.
